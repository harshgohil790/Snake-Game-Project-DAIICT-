<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<br>
Our project is on the snake game where the player controls a snake that grows in size as it consumes fruit. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the play area.
<br>

## 2. Installation

To run the Snake game, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites:

- C++ compiler 
- Windows Operating System 

### Steps:

1. download the source code to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal in the directory where the source code is located.
3. Compile the code:
   - For g++, run: `g++ -o snake_game snake_game.cpp`
4. Run the compiled executable:
   - On Windows: `snake_game.exe`
   
## 3. Usage

After successfully installing and running the game, you can interact with it using the following controls:

- W: Move up
- A: Move left
- S: Move down
- D: Move right
- X: Quit the game
- R: Restart the game after game over

### Game Features:

- The snake moves in a grid and collects food represented by "F."
- The snake grows in size with each food it consumes.
- The game ends when the snake hits the boundaries or collides with itself.
- The score is displayed on the screen, and the high score is saved in `highscore.txt`.

### Functions

- generate()-> it generates food at random positions in the grid.
- move()  -> it helps in swapping the position of tail in x and y direction.
- draw()  -> it helps in creating grid, food and of snake.
- input() -> it helps in taking input from user. we used two windows defined function kbhit() which is used for respond when 
             no input is given from user side and use _getch() function for scanning character which user give.
  <br>
-logic()  -> it is used to give conditions of termination of game. Game terminates when snake collides with it's own body 
             parts or with boundaries of grid. This function also increase length of snake when it eats fruit and increase 
             score by  10.

## 4. Data Structure Analysis
   
The program uses the following data structures and object-oriented concepts to represent the game:
    
### Data Structures Used:

#### Arrays:
-We have used array to represent snake body and 2D array in form of nested form to represent grid.
- The `tailX[]` and `tailY[]` arrays store the positions of the snake's tail. These arrays are used in conjunction with the `nTail` variable to keep track of the snake’s growing body.

#### Enum:
- The `Direction` enum helps manage the snake's direction, making the code more readable and preventing errors with direction management.

#### Class-based structure:
- The game is divided into three classes: `Food`, `Snake`, and `Grid`. This class-based structure provides modularity, separation of concerns, and encapsulation of related data and behaviors.

### Object Relationships:

- The `Grid` object contains instances of both the `Food` and `Snake` objects. The `Grid` class manages the game’s state, including drawing the screen, handling user input, and updating the game logic.
- The `Snake` object is responsible for the movement of the snake and collision detection.
- The `Food` object randomly places food on the grid and generates new food when eaten by the snake.

## 5. Conclusion
   
This Snake game is an enjoyable and simple implementation that uses basic C++ programming concepts such as arrays, classes, and user input handling. It provides an interactive experience with a growing snake that tries to consume food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.
